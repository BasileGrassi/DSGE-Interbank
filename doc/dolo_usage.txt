# How to compile YAML files for matlab using dolo :

* Open a terminal

* Change the directory for the directory where the .yaml file is

* Type: `dolo-matlab.py –solve filename.yaml filename.m`

* Enjoy



# Install Dolo on Windows

* Install a python environment: [Python(x,y)](http://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/) or [EPD](http://enthought.com/products/epd.php)

* Install [Git](http://git-scm.com/). This is needed until dolo is stabilized and is released as binaries. It makes tracking new versions easier.

* Open git bash and move to the directory where you want dolo to stay. Then grab last version:
`git clone https://albop@github.com/albop/dynare-python.git`

* Go where the installation script is located: `cd dynare-python/dolo/`

* Install dolo: `python setup.py install`
